# React Template README

This React Template was built to help students understand concepts of Web App development and quickly build a feature rich Web App prototype. 

## Features

### UI Components
> This template already includes `react-bootstrap` so you don't need to install it. `react-bootstrap` has a lot of useful React UI components and utilities. There are additional custom components in the template to help you build your UI faster.
### Database Access
> This template includes a library that allows you to connect to your own database and make requests to create, read, update, and delete data from storage. Data on this database server is not secure and should not be used for real deployment. See Hooks.useDatabase.
### User Authorization
> This template includes a library that allows you to sign up, log in, and logout users using their email and password. Passwords are stored encrypted on the the database so they can not be read.  See Hooks.useAuth.

### Simplified Forms
> Create forms faster with this template. The `<Forms>` and `<Input>` components make creating form easy. Validate form data by specifying the `type` and `required` prop. Form data from submission is easily extracted.

### HTTP Fetch
> This template includes helper functions to simplify making HTTP requests to get data from web APIs.

 ### Error Handling
 > This template simplifies error handling and catches network errors, authentication errors, database errors, etc. The template also provides a useful component `<ErrorAlert>` to show errors in your app.

 ### Debugging Tools
 > This template includes tools to help you debug your Web App. `<ObjectInspector>` is a component that allows you to inspect your data directly in your app. `<DBExplorer>` allows you to connect to your database collection and check if the data in the database is correct.
### Routing
> Routing (`react-router-dom`)has been added to the template. When you are ready to add client side routing to your application the library is ready for you to use.
